# Website

This website can be seen live at [orth.uk](https://orth.uk), and was built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/). It replaced my old website, still vievable at [old.orth.uk](https://old.orth.uk).

Comments are stored in GitHub issues using [utterances](https://utteranc.es) in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ben-xD/orth.uk-comments).
