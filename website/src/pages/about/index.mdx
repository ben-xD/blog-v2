### Summary 🚀 {#summary}

I work on software to [help people](/projects), [for work](https://linkedin.com/in/bbutterworth/), or both. My principles are: 
- **solve problems for people** - especially by understanding things and making them simpler,
- **keep learning** - especially learning by trying, failing and succeeding, **and**
- **help others learn** - especially the ones who love learning.
- **habits over achievements** - Value what I keep doing, not what I've done or achieved.
- **Feedback** - listen and keep feedback loop tight
