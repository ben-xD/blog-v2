## Why?

You might want to play music or sounds running on Android phone on your macOS instead because your ears deserve better. In my case, I want to listen to the instructor playing on an Android app ([Fiit](https://fiit.tv/)) on my speakers. Romain Vimont, an inventor of popular and useful software is a hero once again, by making [`sndcpy`](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy).

- Your Android device doesn't have an Audio jack...
- Your speakers aren't bluetooth...
- You don't want to use your headphones. 
  - I do not want to sweat onto my headphones, or
  - I want to share my music with others.
- Your macOS is connected via AUX cable (or USB-C/HDMI) to speakers, so **let's use them**.

## Pre-requisites

- Command line experience, or just being resourceful.
- `adb` installed and usable. To install, run `brew install android-platform-tools`
- VLC installed in your `/Applications` folder: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
- Open Terminal.app (already installed at `/Applications/Utilities.Terminal.app`) or [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)

## Installation steps

- Download the sndcpy APK and script from [rom1v/sndcpy on GitHub](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy), and place them in `/usr/local/bin`

  - Unzip the file downloaded from Github and move them using `sudo mv -t /usr/local/bin ~/Downloads/sndcpy/sndcpy ~/Downloads/sndcpy/sndcpy.apk`
  - This APK is installed to your android device whenever you run `sndcpy`

- Create a script called `vlc` in `/usr/local/bin` by running `sudo vim /usr/local/bin/vlc`, and passing the following content:

  - ```bash
    /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I rc "$@"
    ```

  - The reason we put it in `/usr/local/bin` is that your mac will instantly be able to use it like a command, by calling `vlc` (once you restart the shell üêö).

  - Optional: Confirm the file contains those contents, by running `cat /usr/local/bin/vlc`

- Make the file executable to you and the group: `sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/vlc`

- Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` so that `sndcpy` can get the APK whenever it wants to install it onto your device:

  - ```
    export SNDCPY_APK=/usr/local/bin/sndcpy.apk
    ```

- Restart your shell, or reload that file: `source ~/.zshrc`

## Usage steps

- Connect android device to computer (or attach it remotely via adb)
- Run `sndcpy` in terminal
