# Cargo Registry authentication workaround
This is a workaround to authenticating with an *alternative* cargo registry like Artifactory, a feature that is not yet available in Cargo.
<!--truncate-->
## Introduction üëã
- There has been a [Cargo MR: Implement RFC 3139: alternative registry authentication support](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10592), to add support to Cargo to authenticate with Registries when downloading crates. Currently, Cargo only sends authentication tokens for publish and yank network requests. Unfortunately, this MR has been open quite a while - since April 2022.
- **Workaround:** This workaround works by injecting a basic authentication token to requests to the specific cargo registry.
- **Background:** I noticed a colleague implementing a workaround using [proxy.py](https://pypi.org/project/proxy.py/). However, this tool might be more versatile, so it requires more config for MITM proxying, including generating certificate authorities and programatically mutating config files. I knew of `mitmproxy` which could potentially do things a bit more cleanly, and was a bit curious how it would work with Cargo. I also knew this attempt would be more open-source-able.
## Pause: easier solution üê£
- There is an even easier solution.
- If your crates are not sensitive, you could just disable authentication when downloading crates. There is an option to do this for Jfrog Artifactory repositories (for artifactory admins).
## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
*These are setup instructions. You only do this once per machine. They are written for macOS so adjust them for other platforms if necessary.*
- **Pre-requisites:** Rust and Cargo: `brew install rust`
- [Install mitmproxy](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-installation/): run `brew install mitmproxy`
    - This installs `mitmproxy`, `mitmdump` and more.
    - Note, you can also `python3 -m pip install mitmproxy`, which installs binaries in e.g. `/Users/$USER/Library/Python/3.9/lib`. Be sure to add this to your path.  For example, in `~/.zshrc`, add `export PATH=/Users/$USER/Library/Python/3.9/lib:$PATH`
- Run `mitmproxy`, and close it: run `mitmproxy` and then quit: `Ctrl + C`, type `yes`
    - This will generate the certificate authority certificates in `~/.mitmproxy`.
- Create a file: `add_cargo_auth_header.py` is:
```python
from mitmproxy import http
import base64
import os

REGISTRY_DOMAIN = "example.jfrog.io"

def request(flow: http.HTTPFlow):
    if flow.request.pretty_host == REGISTRY_DOMAIN:
        # If you prefer hardcoding your email and token in your script. This is okay if you don't commit your file
        email = "user@example.com"
        token = "replace this with your token"
        
        # Or if you prefer environment variables.
        email = os.environ["EMAIL"]
        token = os.environ["TOKEN"]
        
        encoded_token = base64.b64encode(f"{email}:{token}".encode())
        flow.request.headers["Authorization"] = b"Basic " + encoded_token

    # Optional: Handle more registries here.
```
- Configure cargo to use your registry and this proxy
    - Adjust your desired config file, to use the **mitmproxy** certificate authority. 
        - To affect a single project, adjust `.cargo/config.toml`. For more information, see [The Cargo Book: Configuration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure).
        - For example, update your `.cargo/config.yaml` to look like:
            - This example uses an "Jfrog Artifactory" Cargo registry. Be sure to update the cainfo file path
```toml
[registries.example]
index = https://example.jfrog.io/artifactory/git/cargo-repository.git

[http]
proxy = "localhost:9001"
# on macOS
cainfo = "/Users/ben/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca.pem"
# in a Docker container
# cainfo = "/root/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca.pem"

[net]
git-fetch-with-cli = true
```
- Authenticate with the Registry index
    - The index contains the information about all crates
    - Warning: update `EMAIL` and `INDEX_DOMAIN`.
```bash
# Replace @ with %40
EMAIL=user@example.com
REGISTRY_DOMAIN=example.jfrog.io/
SAFE_EMAIL=${EMAIL/@/%40}
git config --global url."https://${SAFE_EMAIL}:${TOKEN}@/${REGISTRY_DOMAIN}".insteadOf "https://${REGISTRY_DOMAIN}"
```
## Usage üéÆ
- Start the local proxy server: either
    - for interactive: run `mitmproxy --listen-port 9001 -s add_cargo_auth_header.py`
    - for no interactivity: run `mitmdump --listen-port 9001 -s add_cargo_auth_header.py`
        - You can replace `9001` with whichever port you prefer.
- Launch cargo as normal in a separate terminal. e.g. `cargo build`, `cargo run`, etc.
## Bonus: Usage in CI üéÅ
- To use it programatically (e.g. in CI), you could run:
```bash
# Start proxy server
mitmdump --listen-port 9001 -s add_cargo_auth_header.py &
# Use cargo as normal
cargo build # or cargo update, cargo run, etc.
# Kill proxy server
kill %1
```
## Conclusion üèÅ
- I look forward to deleting this local proxy server when this feature is available in Cargo. In the mean time, I've got a consistent way to access other registries securely.
