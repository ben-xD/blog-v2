**CalendarMD has one sole purpose of existence:** deleting events from google calendar in bulk, so I called it CalendarMD, where the MD stands for mass deleting. You search for the events in a specific calendar, and a list shows up. Scroll through the list to make sure you want to delete those events, and press delete.

I made a [Free Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.fresla.bed) with react-native. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ben-xD/calendarMD). Neither the style nor the code look not pretty, but it was the first app I made on React Native. Thinking back, this shouldn't have been a mobile app, and would have done better as a web app, because people are not going to install an app just to delete events from their calendar. I've since built another app for tracking the carbon footprint of food, [Foodprint](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.orth.foodprint).
